I am Jashanpreet kaur from department of Computer Science Engineering.Today is my first day of training as a student of second year. On first day of the training, we learned about different types of companies such as:                                                                                           * Product based companies                                                                                                                                  * Service based companies                                                                                                                                   * Startups
Then we learned about difference between linux and windows operating systems.As linux is an open source , it is free and we can use it anywhere while windows is not an open source.Linux has more security options whereas windows does not have the same level of security.Also,linux provides privacy and is license-free.
Then, we installed linux on our laptops.Here are the steps we followed:
