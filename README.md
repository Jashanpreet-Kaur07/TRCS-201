DAY 1
I am Jashanpreet kaur from department of Computer Science Engineering.Today is my first day of training as a student of second year. On first day of the training, we learned about different types of companies such as:
        
        Product based companies
        Service based companies
        Startups

Then we learned about difference between linux and windows operating systems.As linux is an open source , it is free and we can use it anywhere while windows is not an open source.Linux has more security options whereas windows does not have the same level of security.Also,linux provides privacy and is license-free.

Then, we installed linux on our laptops.Here are the steps we followed:
 
        Download Oracle VirtualBox 7.1.10    
        Download Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2019
        Download Ubuntu (Linux) 24.04.2 LTS

Then, we learned that 'LTS' means 'Long Term Support' , '24' represents the year , '04' represents the month , '2' represents the version updated.
After downloading these files,we discussed about career options in computer science engineering and also talked about productive companies in each career field.
Then, we came to know about booting and its types.Booting is the process of starting your computer and loading the operating system.

Types of Booting:
      
       Cold or Hard Booting: This refers to start a computer from a completely powered-off state.
       Soft or Warm Booting: This involves restarting a computer without completely cutting off power often done through the operating system.


DAY - 2 

I am Jashanpreet kaur from department of Computer Science Engineering.Today is my second day of training as a student of second year.We learned about some core concepts such as:

Kernel : It is a computer program that is a core of a computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system.

Shell : It is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system.

Types of Shell:

       Bash - Most common shell (Bourne-Again Shell)
       Sh - Original shell (Bourne Shell)
       Zsh - More additional features
      Fish - Interactive and modern

Categories of Shell:

      Command line shell
      Graphical shell

After discussing the linux shell, we learned about the file structure system.This structure organizes how files and directories are arranged on the system.
Then, we covered several basic shell commands:

      ls: Lists the contents of a directory.

      whoami: Displays the current username.

      date: Shows the current date and time.

      cd: Changes the current directory.
        Syntax: cd directory_name

      mkdir: Make new directory.
        Syntax: mkdir directory_name

      cat: Create a file with content.
        Syntax: cat>filename

      touch: Create file without content.
        Syntax: touch filename

      cp: Copies file from one location to another.
        Syntax: cp src_file.txt des_file.txt

      pwd: prints the current working directory.
        Syntax: pwd

      whereis: Locates the binary,source and manual pages files for a command.
        Syntax: whereis command_name

      whatis: Provides a brief one-line description of a commmand.
